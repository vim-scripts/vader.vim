SYNTAX OF .VADER FILE                               *vader-syntax-of-vader-file*
==============================================================================

A Vader file is a flat sequence of blocks each of which starts with the block
label, such as `Execute:`, followed by the content of the block indented by 2
spaces.

 - Given
     - Content to fill the execution buffer
 - Do
     - Normal-mode keystrokes that can span multiple lines
 - Execute
     - Vimscript to execute
 - Expect
     - Expected result of the preceding Do/Execute block
 - Before
     - Vimscript to run before each test case
 - After
     - Vimscript to run after each test case


< Basic blocks >______________________________________________________________~
                                                            *vader-basic-blocks*
                                                                     *vader-3-1*


Given~
                                                                   *vader-given*
                                                                   *vader-3-1-1*

The content of a Given block is pasted into the "workbench buffer" for the
subsequent Do/Execute blocks. If `filetype` parameter is given, `&filetype` of
the buffer is set accordingly. It is also used to syntax-highlight the block
in .vader file.

    Given [filetype] [(comment)]:
      [input text]
<

Do~
                                                                      *vader-do*
                                                                   *vader-3-1-2*

The content of a Do block is a sequence of normal-mode keystrokes that can
freely span multiple lines. A special key can be written in its name
surrounded by angle brackets preceded by a backslash (e.g. `\<Enter>`).

Do block can be followed by an optional Expect block.

Execute~
                                                                 *vader-execute*
                                                                   *vader-3-1-3*

The content of an Execute block is plain Vimscript to be executed.

Execute block can also be followed by an optional Expect block.
>
    Execute [(comment)]:
      [vimscript]
<
In Execute block, the following commands are provided.

 - Assertions
     - `Assert <boolean expr>, [message]`
     - `AssertEqual <expected>, <got>`
     - `AssertNotEqual <unexpected>, <got>`
     - `AssertThrows <expr>`
 - Other commands
     - `Log "Message"`
     - `Save <name>[, ...]`
     - `Restore [<name>, ...]`

                                                                  *g:vader_file*

And the path of the current .vader file can be accessed via `g:vader_file`.

In addition to plain Vimscript, you can also test Ruby/Python/Perl/Lua
interface with Execute block as follows:
>
    Execute [lang] [(comment)]:
      [<lang> code]
<
See Ruby and Python examples {5}{here}.

Expect~
                                                                  *vader-expect*
                                                                   *vader-3-1-4*

If an Expect block follows an Execute block or a Do block, the result of the
preceding block is compared to the content of the Expect block. Comparison is
case-sensitive. `filetype` parameter is used to syntax-highlight the block.

SETTING UP ISOLATED TESTING ENVIRONMENT
==============================================================================

When you test a plugin, it's generally a good idea to setup a testing
environment that is isolated from the other plugins and settings irrelevant to
the test. The simplest way to achieve this is to write a minimal .vimrc such
as follows and start a clean Vim process with it.
>
    set nocompatible
    filetype off

    " Assuming that plugins are installed under ~/.vim/bundle

    " Dependency to vader.vim
    set rtp^=~/.vim/bundle/vader.vim

    " The plugin under test
    set rtp^=~/.vim/bundle/vim-markdown
    set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/vim-markdown/after

    " Enable loading plugins and indent files for specific file types
    filetype plugin indent on
<
Then you can start Vim process with the configuration file and run Vader
tests.
>
    vim -u mini-vimrc +Vader*
<
Consider writing a script to further automate the process. You may refer to
{6}{the one from easy-align}.

< feedkeys() cannot be tested >_______________________________________________~
                                               *vader-feedkeys-cannot-be-tested*
                                                                     *vader-6-1*

The keystrokes given to the feedkeys() function are consumed only after Vader
finishes executing the content of the Do/Execute block. Take the following
case as an example:
>
    Do (Test feedkeys() function):
      i123
      \<C-O>:call feedkeys('456')\<CR>
      789

    Expect (Wrong!):
      123456789
<
You may have expected `123456789`, but the result is `123789456`.
Unfortunately I have yet to find a workaround for this problem. Please let me
know if you find one.


< Some events may not be triggered >__________________________________________~
                                        *vader-some-events-may-not-be-triggered*

{12}{It is reported} that CursorMoved event is not triggered inside a Do
block. If you need to test a feature that involves autocommands on CursorMoved
event, you have to manually invoke it in the middle of the block using
`:doautocmd`.

    Do (Using doautocmd):
      jjj
      :doautocmd CursorMoved\<CR>

This is likely a bug of Vim itself. For some reason, search history is not
correctly updated when searches are performed inside a Do block. The following
test scenario fails due to this problem.
>
    Execute (Clear search history):
      for _ in range(&history)
        call histdel('/', -1)
      endfor

    Given (Search and destroy):
      I'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm
      I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb
      I'm a world's forgotten boy
      The one who searches and destroys

    Do (Searches):
      /street\<CR>
      /walking\<CR>
      /cheetah\<CR>
      /runaway\<CR>
      /search\<CR>

    Execute (Assertions):
      Log string(map(range(1, &history), 'histget("/", - v:val)'))
      AssertEqual 'runaway', histget('/', -2)
